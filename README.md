# AutoPromoterBot
It's sort of like a beaming bot (KINDA)
I made this bot a while back, for a friend. He never used it.

# Commands
```/rbw``` ```/rbw help``` ```/rbw bot```

# Other things
You may need an AntiAFK thing, I just used the one on my own client instead of creating one in here :/

I know it's bad code, I rushed it.

This is pretty customizable, it contains a config with things inside of it. Wowow.
Also has failsafes becuase yes.


# IMPORTANT
It auto accepts friend requests and messages them to join a discord (YOU **NEED** TO CHANGE THE MESSAGES WITHIN THE SOURCE CODE! I WAS TOO LAZY LOL)
Your game chat MUST be in **ENGLISH**
Backend was removed, though some parts are still there (no connection to anything,)

contact me on discord: cryzis.
